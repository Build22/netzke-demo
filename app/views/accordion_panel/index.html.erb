<h2>Two GridPanels loaded dynamically</h2>
<p>Two-panel accordion, where panels, at the moment of being expanded, dynamically load two differently configured GridPanels.</p>

<pre><code>
netzke :two_grid_panels,
          :class_name => "AccordionPanel",
          :items => [{
            :class_name => "GridPanel",
            :model => "Boss",
            :name => "bosses"
          }, {
            :class_name => "GridPanel",
            :model => "Clerk",
            :name => "clerks"

<h2>A panel and a BorderLayoutPanel, where the latter is active</h2>

<p>The accordion gets loaded with the first panel being "active", i.e. pre-loaded and open. The second panel is a BorderLayoutPanel with two panels - a grid and a form</p>
