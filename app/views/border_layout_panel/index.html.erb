<% title "BorderLayoutPanel" %>
<b>Basepack::BorderLayoutPanel</b>, besides easy nesting of other components, keeps track of its regions sizes and collapsed/expanded states. Try to resize or collapse regions, then refresh the page. Note, that the state is stored in the database, <i>not</i> in the cookies.<br>
Also note, that it's a very stupid component, which simply puts together several GridPanel's with different configuration. See the <%= link_to "source code", "https://github.com/skozlov/netzke-demo/tree/master/app/views/border_layout_panel/index.html.erb" %>.
